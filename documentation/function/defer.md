Rhum.testSuite("defer()", () => {
  Rhum.testCase(
    "Should defer a function until the call stack has cleared",
    async () => {
      let deferred = false;
      defer((bool: boolean): void => {
        deferred = bool;
      }, true);
      await delay(50);
      Rhum.asserts.assertStrictEquals(deferred, true);
    },
  );
});
